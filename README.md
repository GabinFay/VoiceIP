Whole Idea:
Text to Speech model work really well to generate realistic voices from samples
In the future, everyone's going to have an assistant Blade Runner style or want to make more music from existing artists
People will want to choose the voice and they'll be easy to clone from existing persons voices
There'll be a need for a voice marketplace and IP system for famous or interesting voices and make money from it
There could also be AI generated voices

Here, we tried to implement the Agent TCP/IP protocol.
The user talks to his AI companion, and ask it to use Morgan Freeman voice instead
The companion then talks to another agent, responsible to sell Morgan Freeman's voice license
We created a frontend so that people can create IP assets with licensing terms for their voices and they're stored in a collection
The companion and the voice agent bargain together until they reach an agreement
Once our companion agrees, it triggers a function to mint a license at the agreed price
Then we can use elevenlabs or another text to speech model to talk in morgan freeman's voice

What we finished:
Frontend for people to create voice IP assets and set the price and the license type as commercial
